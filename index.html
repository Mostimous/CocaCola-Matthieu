        <h2>Origins and Early Years (1886-1919)</h2>
        <h3>"Delicious and refreshing"</h3>
        <p>Coca-Cola's story begins in 1886 when John Stith Pemberton, an Atlanta pharmacist, created a syrup he believed could cure various ailments. Pemberton's concoction, initially known as "Pemberton's French Wine Coca," contained coca leaf extract and kola nut. Frank Robinson, Pemberton's bookkeeper, named the beverage "Coca-Cola" and designed the iconic script logo. On May 8, 1886, the drink was first sold at Jacob's Pharmacy in Atlanta. Unfortunately, Pemberton's health deteriorated, leading him to sell the formula to Asa Griggs Candler in 1888. Under Candler's leadership, the Coca-Cola Company was incorporated in 1892, marking the official beginning of the brand. Candler's marketing prowess played a pivotal role in turning Coca-Cola into a local sensation. He distributed syrup to soda fountains, ensuring its availability across the United States. Candler also secured exclusive rights to the formula and implemented aggressive advertising campaigns, establishing Coca-Cola as a refreshing and exhilarating beverage. The brand's early marketing efforts featured promotional items like calendars adorned with the iconic logo.</p>

        <h2>The Woodruff Era and Global Expansion (1919-1980s)</h2>
        <h3>"What You Want Is a Coke"</h3>
        <p>In 1919, Candler sold the company to a group of investors led by Ernest Woodruff. Ernest's son, Robert Woodruff, took over in 1923, marking the beginning of a new era. Woodruff's visionary leadership catapulted Coca-Cola onto the global stage. The beverage became a symbol of American culture, distributed to U.S. military personnel during World War II. Woodruff's globalization efforts involved establishing bottling plants worldwide, adapting the formula to local tastes, and making Coca-Cola a global phenomenon. The post-World War II period saw Coca-Cola becoming a symbol of the "American way of life." The company continued to expand internationally, and by the 1950s, Coca-Cola had a presence in numerous countries. In 1950, it made history as the first commercial product consumed in space during the Mercury and Gemini missions. The 1980s brought innovation with the introduction of Diet Coke in 1982, Cherry Coke, and the infamous "New Coke" in 1985. The latter, met with public backlash, led to the reintroduction of the original formula as "Coca-Cola Classic."</p>

        <h2>Modern Era and Adaptation (1990s-Present)</h2>
        <h3>"Delicious and refreshing"</h3>
        <p>Entering the 1990s, Coca-Cola faced challenges as consumer preferences shifted, health concerns rose, and competition increased. The company responded by diversifying its product portfolio, introducing non-carbonated options, and expanding into emerging markets like China and India. The 21st century brought digital transformation, and Coca-Cola leveraged digital marketing and social media to connect with a new generation of consumers. In response to health and environmental concerns, Coca-Cola embraced corporate social responsibility initiatives. The company introduced healthier beverage options, focused on sustainability, and addressed environmental issues. Despite challenges, Coca-Cola's timeless appeal and adaptability have allowed it to maintain a prominent position in the global beverage industry. Today, the brand is enjoyed in over 200 countries, reflecting its enduring status as a symbol of refreshment and happiness. With millions of servings consumed daily, Coca-Cola remains a beloved and iconic brand worldwide.</p>
